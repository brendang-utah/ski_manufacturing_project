To-Do

fix urls (seperate apis into another page)

consider moving urls under current url file to a new one called api_urls or smthng
- completed by brendan, changed urls to api_urls

need to redo serializers to use read and write


deleted code:
deleted user b/c django has built in user model that simplified auth
old model:
class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=150, unique=True)
    password = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
    address = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
